## d3ia

A basic d3 + React implementation from Chapter 9 of [D3.js in Action](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/D3.js+in+Action,+Second+Edition:+Data+visualization+with+JavaScript/9781617294488/kindle_split_018.html#ch08).

Contains a world map, brush, bar chart, stream graph, and statistics bar. Hover highlighting persists over the map, chart, and graph. The brush can be used to filter selections and brushed statistics are displayed in the statistics bar.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
